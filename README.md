## Description

**Foliage+ Lite** provides basic Foliage improvements like vegetation, flowers, corals, and crops. Certain features will be added soon in the later versions.

As the name suggests, this resource pack is much more lightweight than the original [Foliage+](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/foliage%2B). However, some features like Lower Grass Blocks, Bushier Leaves, etc. will not be included.

## Mods Support

This resource pack should be **compatible** with every mod out there.

Oh, and...
